                  Founded in 2017, The Boring Company is inspired by Musk's frustration with traffic congestion in Los Angeles. He envisions a network of underground tunnels that could facilitate high-speed transportation so as to reduce surface traffic. He hopes to develop new tunneling technologies that make tunnel construction cheaper and more efficient, hence making underground transport more viable for different cities.

            <p>
              Considering Elon Musk's childhood experiences, where he was abused by his biological father and bullied by his schoolmates, Musk has an umempathetic and cold-blooded personality.
              Musk has been showing little empathy towards certain groups, be they transgender individuals or LGBTQ+ groups.  
              He is too judgemental that might hurt others, and only focusing on making profits. 
              As Donald Trump is also a businessman, he proposed political campaign that is beneficial to business sector, which is favourable to Musk. For instance, 
              Musk openly showing supports to Donald Trump by posting on X and delivering speech at Trump's New York Rally. Trump has taken advantage on Elon Musk's influence to attract more supports and convince them to vote for him.

      <br>
      <h3> 
        <strong> Toxic Workplace Culture </strong>  
      </h3>
      <p>
        Throughout the years, Ellon Musk has been involved in legal issues regarding gender discrimination and unfair workplace treatments towards his employees, for examples:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/12/lawsuit-targets-elon-musk-for-sex-bias-unfair-firings-at-spacex.html">
                  Lawsuit of Elon Musk's alleged sex bias and harassment towards females engineers and unfair firings at SpaceX -- the pervasive culture of sexism
                </a>
            </li>
            <li>
               <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-paid-250000-to-a-flight-attendant-who-accused-elon-musk-of-sexual-misconduct-2022-5">
                  Sexual accusation raised by a SpaceX flight attendant 
               </a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        These sexual allegations illustrate that Elon Musk's problematic behaviors might adversely affect the working environment in government departments, such as worsening civil servants' mental health, shrinking the morale and team spirits among departments, hence reducing the administration efficiency in the long term. 
        Employees might not speak up for themselves due to the fear of retaliation, overall damaging the trust between Elon Musk and his officers, and that is definitely not beneficial to all stakeholders.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>
        <strong> Sexism </strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1756750454237659616?lang=en">
            "Boobs just rock, it's a fact," he wrote on Twitter, alongside a meme of a man distracted by a woman's cleavage.
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://x.com/PopBase/status/1833729755314802879">
            “Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life”   
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/elon-musk-reveals-his-sexist-side-promotes-post-that-claims-only-high-status-males-should-be-decision-makers-2592752-2024-09-03">
            Elon Musk reveals his sexist side, promotes post that claims only hgh-status males should be decision makers
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        “I will give you a child”: Musk could be actively objectifying women, thinking women are only men's dependents. 
        <br> 
        <br>
        As a public figure, posting such insulting messages on social media greatly damages his reputation, and will continue to affect the image of the US government as a whole.  Giving him the power of a government official might facilitate the dissemination of those discriminatory messages, which might further deepen the male chauvinism problem in society, raising questions of whether people with such inappropriate views should be a government official.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3> 
        <strong> Underlying threat of corruption </strong>
      </h3>
      <br> <p>
        During the 2024 US election, Elon Musk showed more than enough support for Trump, including major donations to Trump's campaign ($132 million USD), a pro-Trump Super PAC (independent expenditure only political committees, $119 million USD), and the Senate Leadership Fund ($10 million).
        <br> 
        <br>
        He also initiated a voter mobilization campaign in critical battleground states, offering daily $ 1M incentives to encourage voter turnout despite facing legal scrutiny.
        <br> 
        <br>
        If Musk was already using monetary incentives to attract voters, it is suspected that he would continue to do similar acts after he gets his position at the DOGE in order to “raise efficiency”, leading to potential corruption among politicians.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>
        <strong> Conflict of interests and widening wealth gap </strong>
      </h3>
      <br>
        <p>
            It is also suspected that Musk may abuse his power to implement policies that favours his ventures e.g. SpaceX and Tesla or other business sectors, such as reducing tax rates, loosening tariffs, rather than solely focusing on administration efficiency. This might raise suspicions of corruption, as well as potentially widening the wealth gap of the society.
        </p>
      <br>
      <h3>
        <strong> Efficiency</strong>
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Elon Musk is known for being a highly productive and efficient businessman. His innovative thinking principles such as the “First Principle” could bring new insights to the White House, helping departments improve administration productivity in the long run.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> <strong> What is the First principles thinking: </strong>
      <o1>
        <li>Identify and define your current assumptions</li>
        <li>Break down the problem into its fundamental principles</li>
        <li>Create new solutions from scratch</li>
      </o1>
      <br> Encourage innovative thinking/ helps avoid cognitive biases that come from conventional wisdom/ promotes a deeper understanding of the subject matter.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <strong> How the principle can be applied: the story of Tesla </strong> 
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Many experts thought electric cars couldn't work due to the extremely high production cost (USD 600/ Kilowatt), yet Elon Musk always thought there would be a way out. </li>
            <li>He decomposed all the components of the battery pack and minimized them to the most basic materials: carbon, nickel, aluminum and other polymers used for separation. This process helped him understand what constituted the “basic facts” of manufacturing batteries.</li>
            <li>Realizing that the majority of battery cost comes from the human production process, Musk believes there is always room for improvement.</li>
            <li>He began conducting in-depth analysis and experiments of each element with his team, optimizing each part of the manufacturing line, and finally produced electric cars that are built with batteries with dramatically affordable prices. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <strong> The government could hence learn from Tesla's story: </strong>
        <o1>
            <li>Question every requirement in existing systems</li>
            <li>Delete any part of process if you can </li>
            <li>Simplify and optimize</li>
            <li>Cultural shifts towards innovation</li>
        </o1>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>
        <strong> DOGE and the DOGECOIN </strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Elon Musk has long been a supporter of Dogecoin, a type of Cryptocurrency. His tweets often have a massive impact on the liquidity in the cryptocurrency market that one tweet from him can make prices skyrocket or plummet within seconds.
        <br>
        <br>
        Coincidentally, the abbreviation of this department, DOGE, collided with Dogecoin. This instantly arouses discussions on different social media platforms, triggering an enthusiastic market reaction and inspiring the currency to surge by 20%, becoming one of the biggest winners in the post-election rally, with a growth of 153% since election day. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This shows that Elon Musk's participation in the political field still influences the market tremendously.
